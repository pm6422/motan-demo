                <h2>Remote Procedure Call Demo Client</h2>
                <span>In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program calls a procedure (subroutine)
                    to execute in a different address space(commonly on another computer on a shared network),
                    which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call,
                    without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction.
